Memberwise Assigenment

Example:

Rectangle r1, r2;

r1. setWidth(10);
r1.setHeight(10);

r2 = r1;

We can assign one object instance to another object instance.(Same applies to structs).

ex:

class student{

  private:
    int id;
    char *name;
}

student s1, s2;

s2 = s1;

What will be copied?
A)The int will be directly copied and the variable "*name" coppies address of where the data is stored.

Try to change the name of s2.(strcpy(s2.name,"bill")), then print it out.

copy constructor

a copy constructor is a special constructor that is called whenever:
  - a new object is created.
  - initalized with another objects data
  - an object is sent as a peramiter.

When the copy constructor is called:
1) Decare the object instance with another instance value.
   - students s2(s1);
2) Declare the object instance with aassignment
   - students s2 = s1;
3) Send the object instance as a function peramiter
   - changevalue(s1);

class student{
  private:
    int id;
    string name;
    double *scores;
  public: 
    
}
The point to the score memory location, will cause the original scores to be changed.
